## About:
a curve on a plane that winds around a fixed center point at a continuously increasing or decreasing distance from the point. a three-dimensional curve that turns around an axis at a constant or continuously varying distance while moving parallel to the axis; a helix.

## Abstract:

Argument: The harmonic series of a fundamental sound (fig. 1) follows the pathway of the equiangular spiral (fig. 2). In (physics) acoustics the harmonic series of a fundamental sound analysis is made only from the perspective of a linear approach 1 only and the same approach carries over to the Theory of Music 2 . In Physics Fourier analysis brings representations of different sinusoidal wave sum models, which may not necessarily be linear. This however does not convey the inherent properties of the harmonics series which is the point the we will try illustrate by making use of the logarithmic spiral. (When Descartes discovered the spiral in the 17th century, music was leaving "the Quadrivium", the arena of sciences (Coelho, 1969)) until the recovery with the scientific aesthetics started in the middle of the 19th century with Hanslick and continued into the next century with Ghyka. 1 Fourier analysis does not refer to the relation between harmonics but to the "representation of sound's frequencies as sum of pure sinusoidal waves" 2 Pythagoras explained the perfect intervals as consonances resulting from the perfect mathematical relations of the first triangular numbers 1,2,3 and 4 ("perfect" these proportions in the sense that they will not change with any reference point, e.g. fig.1: following the harmonic (pitch/frequency) series for the other intervals the proportions will be multiple instead (imperfect): 5/4 and 9/7 and 11/9 for the major third; 6/5 and 7/6 for the minor third, etc) Continuing the Pythagorean tradition (where the perfect intervals were the expression of the universal harmony in terms of proportions _ lengths: 1/2 for the perfect octave, 2/3 for the perfect fifth and 3/4 for the perfect forth and 1/length = pitch_ together with philosophical & mathematical models ("circle of fifths", Apel, 1976), in the same tradition Boethius and Zarlino explained further intervals (Apel, 1976) relating to those to same arithmetical, and geometrical models (Boethius: the major/minor third as arithmetic/harmonic mean of the octave; Zarlino the major/minor chord)
